# French Funds Analysis with ML & LLM

## About the Project

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of French investment funds using advanced machine learning techniques and large language models. The analysis harnesses the power of the Google Gemini API and scikit-learn, among other tools, to derive insights and predictions from financial data. The entire analysis is performed interactively within Jupyter Notebook, ensuring an easy-to-follow workflow.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Analysis:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebook for a step-by-step interactive exploration of funds data.
- **Advanced ML Integration:** Implements predictive modeling and data analysis using scikit-learn.
- **LLM & Natural Language Processing:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to process and analyze large volumes of textual financial data.
- **Comprehensive Financial Insights:** Provides detailed analysis and visualization of French investment funds data.
- **Automated Data Management:** Streamlines data retrieval and updates for continuous analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy
  - statsmodels
  - scikit-learn
  - prophet
  - google-generativeai
- Access to the Google Gemini API (ensure you have the necessary credentials and API keys for authentication)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barhador/French-Funds-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd French-Funds-Analysis
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up your Google Gemini API credentials (refer to the [Google Gemini API documentation](https://developers.google.com/gemini) for detailed instructions).
5. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook files to follow along with the interactive analysis.
- Execute code cells to perform data analysis, machine learning predictions, and visualize results.
- Each notebook cell is thoroughly commented to guide you through the process of fund analysis using both traditional ML methods and modern LLM approaches.
